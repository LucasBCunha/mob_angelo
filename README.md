## Introduction
This app helps when an emergency event  happens. This event can be anything from a moment of diziness to a heart attack, in which the user needs help from other people phisically nearby. In this implementation events are simulated by the pressing of a button that will send a preconfigured message. But events could be determined by integrating with other devices (e.g a smart watch that measures heart rate).
